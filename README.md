This is a fork of the Drum Machine built using a Teensy 4.1 by albnys.
Everything is built, designed and programmed by him, I intend to add bpm readout, midi in, and potentially cv.
I have created pcb's and cleaned up the schematic; feedback is appreciated.


amazon referral links are primarily to fund my synth habit and make sure pcbs' and designs are as accurately reproduced as possible!

Thanks!
